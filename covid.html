On the 7th January 2020, Chinese scientists isolated the unknown viral sample from an infected person and sequenced its genome using the next gene sequencing tool. They reported that the virus had 96.3% genetic similarity with a Yunnan bat coronavirus RaTG13 and 70% homology with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). On the 12th January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the cause of this epidemic outbreak was a novel coronavirus discovered in 2019 (2019-nCoV) or SARS-CoV-2 and named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the answer to the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. The SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly to other countries including South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Italy, Iran, Spain, USA, UK and was classified by the WHO as a pandemic on 12th March 2020.

<h1 align="center">SYMPTOM COVID-19</h1>
<p align="center">Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Common symptoms include headache, loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties. People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time.<br>Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19</p>
